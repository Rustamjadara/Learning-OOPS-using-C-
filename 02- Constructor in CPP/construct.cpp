/*A constructor is a member function of a class which initializes objects of a class. In C++, Constructor is automatically called when object(instance of class) create. It is special member function of the class.
A constructor is different from normal functions in following ways:

Constructor has same name as the class itself
Constructors donâ€™t have return type
A constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
If we do not specify a constructor, C++ compiler generates a default constructor for us (expects no parameters and has an empty body).
